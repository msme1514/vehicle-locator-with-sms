## Project Title: Vehicle Locator Android Application

Project Description:
The Vehicle Locator Android Application was developed as my Final Year Project (FYP) to address the challenge of tracking university transport vehicles in real time, especially during a period when 3G and 4G connectivity and GPS-based smartphones were not yet common in Pakistan. The goal of the project was to provide students with an easy and reliable way to determine the current location of university buses without requiring internet access.

The application operated on an Android device installed in the bus. It was designed to automatically send the vehicle’s real-time location in response to an SMS query from a student or transport coordinator. Upon receiving a specific SMS command (e.g., “Where is the bus?”), the app would use the device’s GPS to obtain the current coordinates and Google APIs—including Google Maps and Google Places—to determine the nearest recognizable landmarks or places within a 50-meter radius. The system then replied with an SMS containing both the coordinates and the nearby location name (e.g., “Near Nagan Chowrangi, Karachi”).

This project demonstrated the integration of telecommunication (SMS), GPS, and Google’s location-based services to deliver a cost-effective and accessible vehicle tracking solution for environments with limited internet connectivity. It also showcased practical skills in Android development, API integration, background service management, and SMS-based automation.

## Key Features:

1) SMS-based real-time vehicle tracking without requiring mobile internet access.

2) Automatic location detection using GPS and Google APIs.

3) Identification of nearest recognizable places within a 50-meter radius.

4) Designed for deployment in university buses to inform students of bus arrival status.

5) Lightweight and compatible with older Android devices.

## Technologies Used:
Android SDK, Java, Google Maps API, Google Places API, GPS Services, SMS Manager
